# Persian letters on German keyboard

Custom XKB keyboard layout variant for Persian letters on a German keyboard. Takes the standard German layout as a basis and overwrites the mapping as convenient.

I could have sworn that I once used such a layout that came pre-installed with the system, but couldn't find it anymore, so I made my own.

## Installation

1. Add everything in `de_ir` to the symbols file for the German keyboard `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/de`. 
2. Add the variant in `evdev.xml` to the German layout in `/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules`.
